# Ahmed Hamdy

Hi! I'm Ahmed, a passionate penetration tester dedicated to identifying and mitigating security risks in today's complex digital landscape. I thrive on tackling intricate security challenges, leveraging a mix of industry-standard tools and custom scripts to simulate real-world attack scenarios. I'm actively building my career in cybersecurity through practical experience, advanced certifications, and a commitment to continuous learning.

Through this blog, I share in-depth write-ups on Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, penetration testing techniques, and key technical insights I've gained along the way. My goal is to provide others with practical knowledge, spark curiosity, and contribute to a shared journey of growth in cybersecurity.

Letâ€™s connect, explore, and strengthen our skills together!
